A simple and effective plugin to synchronize your Astra Theme settings with Elementor Global Styles.

== Description ==
The Astra & Elementor Sync Bridge plugin is designed to streamline your design workflow by automatically synchronizing your key Astra Theme settings directly into Elementor's Global Styles. This ensures a consistent look and feel across your entire website without the need for manual color and typography adjustments.

With this plugin, you can easily synchronize:

Global Colors: Map your Astra-defined colors for headings, links, body text, and accents to Elementor's Global Colors.

Global Typography: Sync font family, size, weight, and other typography settings to Elementor.

The plugin provides a simple interface in the WordPress dashboard to trigger the synchronization with a single click.
